This was the final group project in the third semester from the Data Science for Business Applications course. 

This project aims at examining the music industry to provide actionable insights for involved artists. It is becoming increasingly difficult for them to be discovered by listeners and the costs of being promoted are high. To address this problem, this analysis investigates what makes a song popular, how the industry is organized, and which themes predominantly occur in the lyrics. The analysis' underlying data is fetched from the APIs of Spotify and Genius and thereafter analyzed with methods from the areas of machine learning, network analysis, and natural language processing. Based on the analysis, it is proposed that (I) a track's danceability, instrumentalness, and loudness positively influence its popularity, (II) artist's collaboration behaviour differs across genres, and (III) that there are considerable differences between genres with regards to what they are singing about. By providing those insights, this study helps artists to make a more informed decision about their song-production and collaboration strategy.
